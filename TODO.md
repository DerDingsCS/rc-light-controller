# General

* Add i-Bus

* Remove support for old firmware versions, always use the latest firmware
    * But: still support old config versions
        * Notify when feature is used that does not exist anymore, like CPPM, Winch

* Phone still shows "CPPM" is a bug in the Configurator
    * May be related to v2_hide not working on the phone?
