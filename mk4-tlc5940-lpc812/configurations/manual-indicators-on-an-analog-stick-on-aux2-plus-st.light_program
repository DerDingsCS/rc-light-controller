// Manual indicators on an analog stick on AUX2, with ST hold
//
// This light program implements indicators that are controlled
// by an analog stick (e.g. left horizonal gimbal on a transmitter) that
// returns to center.
//
// The indicators blink as long as the stick is held in the direction.
// When the stick is released they continue to blink for a certain
// amount of time.
//
// The indicators keep blinking in the same direction if the steering input
// is held in the same direction. So you can start the indicator by tapping
// AUX2, keep driving the corner using the steering wheel, and the indicators
// will only stop after you returned the steering to neutral (or the opposite
// direction)
//
// Note that we also have to manually implement the hazard lights since
// we are taking over the indicator LEDs.
