# Light program assembler

Light programs are simple programs that are interpreted by the LANE Boys RC light controller (Mk4 TLC5940 LPC812 version).

## Build instructions

The following tools are needed:

- GNU Make - [https://www.gnu.org/software/make/](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  Windows executable is available at [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

- Node.js - [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)

After installing these tools, run ``make`` to build the assembler as needed for the configurator, plus a command line version.
