This is a programmer for the NXP LPC812 and LPC832 micro-controller, using the ISP (serial) protocol.

It connects to a PC or Android phone via USB and uses WebSerial (available in Chrome, Opera and Edge browsers) to communicate with a web app.

The great thing about this programmer is that no driver or software needs to be installed. Just connect a USB-to-serial adapter to the PC, load the Light Controller .HEX file in the web browser, and program your light controller.
