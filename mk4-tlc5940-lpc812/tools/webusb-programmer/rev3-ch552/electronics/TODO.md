# TODO for Rev 3 of the WebUSB programmer hardware

* Increase reverse-mount LED hole to 2.1mm
* Reduce holes for Micro-USB slightly (tbd how much)


# TODO for Rev 2 of the WebUSB programmer hardware

DONE Change Micro-USB connector to one that has through-hole mounts
    DONE Ensure solder pads are longer!
    DONE Place the USB connector on the opposite side
DONE Change output resistors to resistor network
DONE Make all LED reverse mount so we can solder them in one go
    DONE Consider changing to 1204
DONE Replace 47uF Tantal with 0805 MLCC (1..10u?)
DONE Use flat pin header like on light controller
